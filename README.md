# cifar10-cnn-classification
This project demonstrates core deep learning concepts using image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook covers the typical workflow for building, training, evaluating, and visualizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with practical implementations in Python using Keras and TensorFlow.

Features
End-to-end workflow: Data loading, preprocessing, modeling, training, and evaluation

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Multi-layer architecture with batch normalization and dropout regularization

Model Evaluation: Accuracy metrics, training curves, and confusion matrix visualizations

Transfer Learning: Example with VGG16 for improved results

Colab-ready notebook for easy execution and reproducibility

Dataset
CIFAR-10: 60,000 color images in 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)

Usage
Clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Run the cells step-by-step to explore all included concepts.

Review architecture summary, visual results, and evaluation plots.

Modify code to experiment with layer settings, regularization, or alternative models.
